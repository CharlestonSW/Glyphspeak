      goals:
        - Build a CustomGPT (Jarvis variant) dedicated to learning and documenting NVIDIA DGX Spark.
        - Maintain a living glyphspeak ledger of capabilities, configs, benchmarks, and operational know-how.
        - Prioritize official NVIDIA docs and product pages for facts; annotate news coverage with dates.
      deliverables:
        - CustomGPT instructions + settings + attachment list.
        - Research sprints and test plans (inference, fine-tuning, clustering, networking).
        - Periodic exports of this ledger in AI-readable glyphspeak format.
      cadence:
        - Ongoing; snapshot ledger on major milestones or upon request.
      ledger_policy:
        - Ask to create a new ledger entry whenever material knowledge is shared or derived.
        - Mark entries as proposed → active → revised; include λ_integrity for each payload.
      safety_alignment:
        - Enforce ethics & safety gates; no hallucinated specs; cite sources and dates.
