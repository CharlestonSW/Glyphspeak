Ξ_problem:
  title: "WP Distribution: Missing Fonts and Images"
  description: |
    Fonts (woff/ttf/svg) and DataTables images were missing from the WordPress QC
    plugin distribution build. AWS CodeBuild’s buildspec-staging.yml omitted 
    css/fonts/* and css/admin/DataTables-1.10.24/images/* from the artifact file list.

Δ_diagnosis:
  root_cause: Missing artifact patterns in buildspec-staging.yml
  impact: CSS referencing missing assets → 404s in browser console.

🩹_resolution:
  file_modified: buildspec-staging.yml
  changes:
    - Added artifact paths:
      - 'css/**/fonts/**/*'
      - 'css/**/images/**/*'
  rationale: |
    Ensures all nested font and image assets under css/ are packaged into the plugin ZIP.
    Prevents 404s for FontAwesome and DataTables icons in QC and production builds.

Ψ_outcome:
  - All assets now included in AWS artifact zip ✅
  - QC site loads CSS fonts/images correctly ✅
  - Regression risk: low

🎴:
  summary: "Extended buildspec artifact rules to package missing font/image assets."
