  description: >
    Resolves false “Could not update the location data.” notifications
    when editing a location in the Store Locator Plus® system.
    Applies to both the WordPress plugins and the MySLP SaaS platform.
  cause: >
    \SLPlus_Location::MakePersistent and related insert/update calls
    treated 0 rows updated as failure because of a non-strict
    truthy check on wpdb->update() / wpdb->insert().
  correction: >
    Use strict equality (=== false) to detect genuine SQL errors.
    Zero row updates are valid when only extended data changes.
  affected_paths:
    - classes/class.slplus-location.php
    - modules/power/includes/category-save.php
    - modules/experience/includes/marker-save.php
  test_matrix:
    - main update > 0 only → success
    - ext update > 0 only → success
    - no updates (0/0) → success
    - any === false error → failure
  outcome: "False error toast eliminated; genuine SQL failures still reported."
