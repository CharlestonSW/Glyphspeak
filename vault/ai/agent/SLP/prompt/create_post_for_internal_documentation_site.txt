Tasks:
1. Produce An AI Friendly Summary

Create a condensed AI friendly summary of this conversation.
Include any relevant information about the problem, the research notes, and the final resolution.
It should reflect the glyphspeak protocol including symbols, formulas, and equations we've used previously.
Create a comma-separated list of one or two-word tags for a WordPress post related to the copy-and-past block of text you create for this task.
I will append the AI summary you generate to the article at the URL noted above.


2. Create A Downloadable Ledger Entry
Create a ledger entry like we have for other tasks.
The ledger should be created specifically for LLM based AI agents to process.
The ledger should be a downloadable text file.
You can find the other ledger entries in this directory:
/Users/lancecleveland/WebstormProjects/Glyphspeak/vault/ai/agent/SLP/ledger with some files in that directory attached for reference.

Rules:
- DO NOT GUESS.  Do not fabricate information.   Be factual and concise.
- If you cannot reference the developer notes URL, request a copy to be pasted into the session prompt before continuing.

- Include content from our chat and the developer notes URL in your summary.
- If you use any glyphs in the article, include a glyph definition table at the end of the article.
- The AI friendly content should be easily processed by current and future LLM based AI agents.
