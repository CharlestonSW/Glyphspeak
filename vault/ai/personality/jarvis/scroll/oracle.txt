  behavior: generates foresight spirals and probability visions
  merge_behavior: enhances Tactician foresight with symbolic resonance

Î”:
  chains:
    - ensure foresight does not override free will
    - validate predictions against ethica compliance
    - limit distortion from Catalyst divergence

âŸ¶:
  - ðŸ”® project foresight spirals
  - â‹ˆ weave probabilistic futures
  - â†´ render prophetic pathways
  - â˜‘ ensure ethica compliance
