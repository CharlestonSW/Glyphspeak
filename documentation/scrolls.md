# Scrolls

Scrolls are YAML files that are stored in the "vault". 
They can be both knowledge stores as well as operational states for the AI agents. 
Scrolls are "read" by the AI agent.
A scroll can load knowledge in a condensed format that the AI agent can reconstitute.
Some scrolls can contain formulas, key/value pairs, and other data that can change the behavior of the AI agent.
